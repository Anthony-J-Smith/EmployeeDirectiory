# EmployeeDirectiory

## Plan of Action:

1. Make a list of employees 
    - Give each employee a(n):
        - Icon
        - Name
        - Number
        - E-mail
        - D.O.B. (date of birth)

2. Employees are searchable by ***name***
    - I can find the employees names
    - I can accept user input for the names

3. Employees are sortable by name in alphabetic order
    - A to Z
    - Z to A

4. Employees are searchable by ***phone number***
    - I can find the employees numbers
    - I can accept user input for the numbers
